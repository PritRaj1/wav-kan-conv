# wavKAN-conv2D
A Julia implementation of Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (wavKAN).  Mutli-layer Perceptron (MLP) and wavKAN implementations of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) are applied to learn the solution operator of the 2D Darcy Flow Problem.

The MLP models were developed in a [previous side project](https://github.com/PritRaj1/Neural-Operator-Learning). The commit history attributed to their development can be found there.

## Problem and Data - 2D Darcy Flow

The dataset has been sourced from the University of Cambridge Engineering Department's Part IIB course on [Data-Driven and Learning-Based Methods in Mechanics and Materials.](https://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/content/engineering-tripos-part-iib-4c11-data-driven-and-learning-based-methods-mechanics-and)

The 2D Darcy flow equation on the unit box is a problem in fluid dynamics and porous media flow, described by the partial differential equation (PDE):

$$
-\nabla \cdot (a(x) \nabla u(x)) = f(x), \quad x \in (0,1)^2
$$

where:
- $a(x)$ is the diffusion coefficient generated from a random Fourier field.
- $f(x)$ is a constant forcing function throughout the domain.
- $u(x)$ is the solution field to be learned.

### Boundary Condition

The problem is subject to the Dirichlet boundary condition:

$$
u(x) = 0, \quad x \in \partial(0,1)^2
$$

### Objective

The goal is to learn the operator mapping the diffusion coefficient \(a\) to the solution \(u\), denoted as:

$$
a \mapsto u
$$
